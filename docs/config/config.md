### `parallel`

This is for when multiple inverters are configured. The card has no limit, but all entity lists must have the same numenr of items. When there are multiple inverters configured, there is a selector at the top left of the screen that can be used to select which inverter you want to show the info for. In the list, there is also an entry called **Parallel**. This will add or average all the values between te inverters.

## Example configs

There are several configs that can be used directly when you are using LuxpowerTek integration.

Here are examples for [a single inverter](lux_single_no_sn.yaml) and [dual inverters](lux_dual_no_sn.yaml) that don't have the serial numbers in the entity names. The only functional update to these examples is that the `lux_dongles` needs to be updated with your inverter's serial number to use the refresh functionality.

This example of [a single inverter](lux_single_with_sn.yaml) and [dual inverters](lux_dual_with_sn.yaml) does include the serial number in the entity name. The _single_ example, and one of the _dual_ examples, has the serial number `12345678`. Do a _find-and-replace_ to update it to your inverter's serial number. The second inverter in the _dual_ example has a serial number of `98765432`. The letters at the front of the serial number needs to be updated to use the refresh functionality.
